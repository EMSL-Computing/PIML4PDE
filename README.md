# PIML4PDE: Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Solving Partial Differential Equations

</div>

The **PIML4PDE** framework is designed to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML). This framework is intended for educational purposes, demonstrating steady-state and transient-state PDE problems. Example applications include water flow through homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media, contaminant tranport and heat conduction.  



### **Applications of PIML4PDE**
The PIML codes available here can also be directly applied to the following fields or adapted with modifications:  

#### **Multiphase Flow**
- Models the movement of multiple interacting fluid phases (e.g., water, oil, gas) in porous media.
- Crucial for applications in petroleum engineering, COâ‚‚ sequestration, and groundwater management.

#### **Contaminant Transport**
- Simulates the transport and fate of contaminants in water and soil systems.
- Essential for environmental engineering, pollution control, and risk assessment.

#### **Heat Conduction**
- Models the steady-state temperature distribution in a medium with uniform thermal conductivity and no internal heat sources.
- Useful in thermal engineering and material science applications.

#### **Electrostatics**
- Describes the electric potential in regions without charges.
- Forms the foundation for studying electric fields and potentials, often applied in physics and electronics.

#### **Elasticity Problems**
- Simulates stress distributions in materials under equilibrium conditions.
- Commonly used in mechanical and structural engineering.

#### **Geophysics**
- Solves electrival resistivity, gravitational or magnetic potential field problems.
- Aids in subsurface exploration and resource management.

#### **Image Processing**
- Provides a mathematical basis for techniques such as, edge detection, image smoothing, and noise reduction.
- Useful in computer vision and digital image analysis.

#### **Other Fields**
- Appears in diverse applications such as:
  - Steady-state diffusion processes.
  - Financial modeling for steady-state behaviors.


The **PIML4PDE** framework provides a versatile platform for solving PDEs across various disciplines, demonstrating the broad applicability of physics-informed machine learning.

## Installation

This guide provides a step-by-step approach for cloning the **PIML4PDE** repository, creating a Conda environment named **ml4pde**, and installing the required dependencies on both **Windows** and **macOS** for seamless use of the **PIML4PDE** framework.


### A. Cloning the PIML4PDE Repository
#### 1. Git Installation: Prerequisites for Windows and Mac: If Git is not installed, do the following steps: 

##### For Windows:
1. Download Git for Windows from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Run the installer and follow the setup instructions:
   - During installation, choose the default options unless you have specific preferences.

##### For Mac:
1. Open the Terminal and check if Git is already installed:
```
git --version
```

2. If not installed, you'll be prompted to install it, or download it from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/).


##### For Linux:
1. Open the Terminal and check if Git is already installed:
```
git --version
```

If Git is not installed, install it using:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

2. If Git is not installed, you'll be prompted to install it. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
Alternatively, download Git from Git's official website and install it manually.



#### 2. Cloning the Repository

To clone the **PIML4PDE** repository, follow these steps:

1. Open a Terminal (Mac) or Command Git-Bash/Prompt/PowerShell (Windows).

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository:

```
cd /path/to/your/desired/folder
```

3. Run the command on Terminal: 

```
git clone https://github.com/EMSL-Computing/PIML4PDE.git
```

4. Navigate into the cloned repository:

```
cd PIML4PDE
```



### B. Setting Up a Python Environment for **PIML4PDE** framework Using Conda

#### 1. Install Conda
If Conda is not installed, download and install either [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), depending on your preference.

##### For Windows:
- Download the Anaconda installer for Windows from [Anaconda's official website](https://www.anaconda.com/).
- Run the downloaded `.exe` file to begin the installation.
- Follow the setup instructions:
   - Choose the default options unless you have specific preferences.
   - Optionally, check "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable" during installation.
- After installation, open **Anaconda Prompt** and verify the installation:

```
conda --version
```

##### For Mac:
- Download the Anaconda installer for macOS from [Anaconda's official website](https://www.anaconda.com/).
- Open the downloaded `.pkg` file and follow the instructions to install Anaconda.
- Alternatively, for the command-line installer, open Terminal and run:

```
   bash ~/Downloads/Anaconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

- After installation, restart the terminal or run:

```
   source ~/.bash_profile
```

- Verify the installation:

```
   conda --version
```

##### For Linux:
- Open the Terminal and download the Anaconda installer:

```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

- Run the installer:

```
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

- Follow the prompts to complete the installation:
   - Accept the license terms and choose the installation location (default is recommended).

- Restart the terminal or activate Conda:

```
source ~/.bashrc
```

- Verify the installation:

```
conda --version
```






#### 2. Create and activate the Conda Environment
Open an Anaconda Promt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac or Linux). Run the following command to create a new environment named **ml4pde** with Python 3.9:

```
conda create -n ml4pde python=3.9 -y
```


Activate the newly created environment:

```
conda activate ml4pde
```

#### 3. Install the Required Packages
To install all dependencies from the *requirements.txt* file:


```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


#### 4. Verify the Installation
Type the on Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac or Linux) to lunch Jupyter Notebook: 
```
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the example directory in the browser interface. Open and run the testing script *testing_packages_for_pinn.ipynb*. 

You should see the following printout text after running the testing script and successful installation of all the packages:  
```
Testing imports and basic functionality...

NumPy: OK
JAX: OK
Optax: OK
Matplotlib: OK
Scikit-learn: OK

Testing complete!
```



In case of any errors, follow these steps:

```
pip uninstall <package-name>

pip install <package-name>

```
